	REST API
		Request objects should be specific to each controller and only allow data that's necessary to do the task at hand
		Response objects: Need to create a generic response object with data, error, message, etc.
		Implement each controller, test, create unit test when completed
		Look into authorization roles using net core identity setup

DrinkMix.DataAccess
	MVP
		Cocktail recipes are public. Only the administrator can create them. End users will only be able to rate the cocktails and favorite them.
	Phase 2
		Individuals should be able to make their own recipes for fun and social interactivity. This means a USER -> has MANY recipes.
		Current public recipes will need to be assigned the "drinkmix" user or something so that users know this is a public recipe.
		Recipes will need a createdby field so users know who makes the best cocktails ;)
		Implement favorite and rating features
		Plan out recipe variations, any sort of "whiskey" ingredient replacement, search, etc.
		Write down use cases to model appropriately
